### Merge these files using QCTOOL
For cases
CEU.out.cases.gen
CEU.out.cases.sample

For controls
CEU.out.controls.gen
CEU.out.controls.sample

### STEP 1
COMMAND
./qctool -g CEU.out.controls.gen -s CEU.out.controls.sample -g CEU.out.cases.gen -s CEU.out.cases.sample -og CEU.gen -os CEU.sample

It will produce two files.
CEU.gen "Combined cases and controls data."
CEU.sample "Sample file"

### STEP 2 
In HAPGEN2 controls are identified as 0 and cases as 1. After that we will be using plink so we have to convert controls to 1 and cases to 0.
Run the following python script. It will make modification in CEU.sample file

import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv('CEU.sample',delimiter=" ")
print (data)
data.pheno[data.pheno == "1"] = "2"
data.pheno[data.pheno == "0"] = "1"
print (data)
data.to_csv('CEU.sample', index = False,sep="\t")

After this step we will have two files. CEU.gen and CEU.sample.
python changeCaseControls.py

### STEP 3 
Convert CEU.gen and CEU.sample file to CEU.ped and CEU.map file using Gtool. Make your phenotype type column name is correct. In our case it was "pheno"
./gtool -G --g CEU.gen --s CEU.sample --ped CEU.ped --map CEU.map --phenotype pheno

After this step we will have two files. CEU.ped and CEU.map.

### STEP 4
Perform association test on CEU.ped and CEU.map file using plink and it will generate p-values and ODD ration for each snp.

./plink --file CEU --allow-no-sex --assoc

After this step we will have two files. CEU.ped and CEU.map.
